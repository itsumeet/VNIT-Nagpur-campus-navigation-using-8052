Campus navigation using AT89C52 microcontroller and UBLOX NEO-6M GPS navigator.<br/>

You have to collect coordinates(latitudes and longitudes) of the various places you want to locate inside the campus using google maps.
steps to do it.<br/>
    1. select a building or a location.<br/>
    2. mark 4 extreme points of that location which will ensure a rectangle boundary over the location.<br/>
    3. From those four coordinates i.e, 4 latitudes and 4 longitudes select a maximum and minimum lat & long.<br/>
    4. put it in the array and pair it with the name of the location.<br/>
